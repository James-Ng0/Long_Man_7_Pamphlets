Game Description:
What is the main action in the game:

Longman: The 7 pages is a game in which you run and collect pages while trying not to be seen by LongMan

What was the hardest part of the game to get working in Unreal:

The hardest part was fine tuning the AI for LongMan. While it was very fun and rewarding to learn to use
behavior trees in Unreal, figuring out the best routine and implementing it was difficult.

What is the most interesting part of the game

The most interesting part of the game is LongMan himself. I had fun modelling and rigging him, and some
of the animations I found for him to perform (looking around)
worked really well to get a sort of sweeping vision effect when he looks for you.
I especially like how his animations fit into his routine.
